A simple full React small project that gets data from different APIs and render them in different components.

> I created this project to imporove my knowledge of React and the way components react to each other. 
> I didn't want to spent time on CSS or SASS, therefore i used Tachyons to speed thing up a bit. However the projects design and the way it looks to user is not something i can ignore, so in the end i made it a bit posh!
